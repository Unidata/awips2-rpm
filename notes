We don't want to check in the tar.gz of the src like openfire

    We want to check in the exploded tar of the src ONLY if we are modifying the src
        We modify the src for yajsw
        We do not modify the src for openfire
        qpid?

Each FOSS directory will need a "packaged" directory (anyone have a better name for it?) that is the compiled/built version of the FOSS

    For example, this would contain the openfire.tar.gz since everything necessary to run openfire is all inside that one file
    If we modify the src code of the FOSS, the build scripts would output to the packaged directory
