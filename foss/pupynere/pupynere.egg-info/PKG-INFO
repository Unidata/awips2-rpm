Description: Pupynere is a Python module for reading and writing NetCDF files,
        using the same API as Scientific.IO.NetCDF and pynetcdf. It depends only
        on Numpy, so you don't need to have the NetCDF library installed.
        
        Changelog:
        
        1.0.15
        Added fix for empty attributes.
        
        1.0.14
        Added support for Unicode attributes.
        
        1.0.13
        Fixed bug when reading character variables without mmap.
        
        1.0.12
        Fixed bug.
        
        1.0.11
        Fixed bug.
        
        1.0.10
        Fixed bug when packing integer attributes in 64-bit systems.
        
        1.0.9
        Should work with Python 2.3.
        Accepts file objects instead of only filenames.
        
        1.0.8
        Allow writing version 2 files (Large Files).
        
        1.0.7
        Removed reads from asserts to allow PYTHONOPTIMIZE.
        
        1.0.6
        Allows zero-length record variables.
        
        1.0.5
        Added the option to open files without using mmap, since mmap can't
        handle huge files on Windows.
        
        1.0.4
        Fixed packing of dimensions when writing a file. The order was being
        read from a dictionary (essentially unordered), instead of from the list
        with the proper order.
        
        1.0.3
        Fixed bug so that it can write scalar variables.
        
        1.0.2
        Fixed broken 1.0.1, ``var.shape`` was returning the current number
        of records in the first dimension, breaking the detection of record
        variables.
        
        1.0.1
        Changed the code to read the variable shape from the underlying
        data object.
        
        1.0.0
        Initial stable release. Handles record arrays properly (using a single
        mmap for all record variables) and writes files.
