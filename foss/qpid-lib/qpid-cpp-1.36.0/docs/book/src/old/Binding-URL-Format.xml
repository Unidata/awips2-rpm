      Binding URL Format

            <programlisting>
&lt;Exchange Class&gt;://&lt;Exchange Name&gt;/[&lt;Destination&gt;]/[&lt;Queue&gt;][?&lt;option&gt;='&lt;value&gt;'[&amp;&lt;option&gt;='&lt;value&gt;']]
</programlisting>
          <para>
            This URL format is used for two purposes in the code base. The
            broker uses this in the XML configuration file to create and bind
            queues at broker startup. It is also used by the client as a
            destination.
          </para><para>
            This format was used because it allows an explicit description of
            exchange and queue relationship.
          </para><para>
            The Exchange Class is not normally required for client connection
            as clients only publish to a named exchange however if exchanges
            are being dynamically instantiated it will be required. The class
            is required for the server to instantiate an exchange.

            There are a number of options that are currently defined:
