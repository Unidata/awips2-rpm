.SH FILES
.I /etc/qpidd.conf
.RS
Default configuration file.
.RE

Configuration file settings are over-ridden by command line or environment variable settings. '--config <file>' or 'export QPID_CONFIG=<file>' specifies an alternate file.

Each line is a name=value pair. Blank lines and lines beginning with # are ignored. For example:

  # My qpidd configuration file.
  port=6000
  max-connections=10
  log-to-file=/tmp/qpidd.log

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.I QPID_<option>
.RS
There is an environment variable for each option.
.RE

The environment variable is the option name in uppercase, prefixed with QPID_ and '.' or '-' are replaced with '_'. Environment settings are over-ridden by command line settings. For example:

  export QPID_PORT=6000
  export QPID_MAX_CONNECTIONS=10
  export QPID_LOG_TO_FILE=/tmp/qpidd.log
