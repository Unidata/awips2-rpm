Upgrading YAJSW

You will need ant. To install, use the command: yum install awips2-ant

1) Download new yajsw zip file from YAJSW website.
2) Unzip new yajsw zip file in AWIPS2_build/foss. 
3) Rename the new yajsw directory according to AWIPS foss naming conventions (yajsw-#.##).
4) Copy the following from the old yajsw directory into the new yajsw directory: 
   - build.xml
   - patches/
5) Move the old yajsw directory somewhere safe, out AWIPS2_build, in case you need it later.
6) Push the changes that you have so far to GIT, without any patches applied.
7) Apply the patches in the patches directory.
8) Delete the following lib directories:
- lib/extended/commons
- lib/extended/glazedlists
- lib/extended/keystore
- lib/extended/sigar
- lib/extended/vfs-dbx
- lib/extended/vfs-webdav
- lib/extended/yajsw

9) Run the command "ant" in the same directory as build.xml. Ant will build YAJSW and create the zip file.
10) Push all the patches and zip file to GIT in a separate commit.
